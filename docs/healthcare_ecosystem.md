# Healthcare Data Ecosystem

The AIDE-extension is designed to operate within a complex healthcare data ecosystem, bridging the gap between unstructured clinical documents, research literature, and standardized healthcare data formats. This section details the types of data sources, standards, and workflows the extension aims to support.

## Clinical Data Sources

AIDE-extension can process information from a variety of clinical data sources, often found in unstructured or semi-structured formats:

-   **Electronic Health Records (EHRs) & Electronic Medical Records (EMRs):** 
    -   *Description:* Digital versions of patients' paper charts. They contain medical and treatment histories, demographics, problem lists, medications, allergies, immunization status, and laboratory test results.
    -   *AIDE-extension Focus:* Extracting key information from narrative sections, discharge summaries, and progress notes to supplement structured EHR data.
-   **Clinical Notes:**
    -   *Description:* Free-text notes written by physicians, nurses, and other healthcare professionals. These include admission notes, progress notes, consultation reports, and operative notes.
    -   *AIDE-extension Focus:* Deep semantic understanding of clinical narratives to extract diagnoses, symptoms, treatments, and outcomes.
-   **Medical Imaging Reports:**
    -   *Description:* Textual reports accompanying medical images (e.g., X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, pathology slides). These reports describe the findings and impressions of the radiologist or pathologist.
    -   *AIDE-extension Focus:* Extracting findings, measurements, and diagnostic conclusions from these specialized reports.
-   **Lab Results:**
    -   *Description:* Reports detailing the results of laboratory tests. While often structured, they may contain comments or interpretations requiring text processing.
    -   *AIDE-extension Focus:* Extracting specific lab values, units, reference ranges, and any accompanying narrative interpretations.
-   **Pathology Reports:**
    -   *Description:* Detailed descriptions of gross and microscopic findings from tissue samples.
    -   *AIDE-extension Focus:* Extracting diagnoses, staging information, and specific biomarkers.
-   **Discharge Summaries:**
    -   *Description:* Comprehensive summaries of a patient's hospital stay, including reason for admission, significant findings, procedures performed, course of treatment, discharge medications, and follow-up plans.
    -   *AIDE-extension Focus:* Extracting a wide range of clinical information critical for continuity of care and research.

## Healthcare Standards Integration

Interoperability is key in healthcare. AIDE-extension prioritizes adherence to and integration with established healthcare data standards:

-   **FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources):**
    -   *Description:* A standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically. FHIR defines data elements (Resources) and an API for their exchange.
    -   *AIDE-extension Role:* Extracted clinical data will be mapped to relevant FHIR Resources (e.g., Patient, Observation, Condition, Procedure, MedicationStatement). The extension will support validation against FHIR profiles and interaction with FHIR-compliant systems like RustEMR.
-   **SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms):**
    -   *Description:* A comprehensive, multilingual clinical healthcare terminology.
    -   *AIDE-extension Role:* Mapping extracted clinical concepts (diagnoses, findings, procedures) to SNOMED CT codes for standardization and semantic interoperability.
-   **LOINC (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes):**
    -   *Description:* A database and universal standard for identifying medical laboratory observations.
    -   *AIDE-extension Role:* Mapping extracted lab tests and observations to LOINC codes.
-   **ICD-10/ICD-11 (International Classification of Diseases):**
    -   *Description:* A medical classification list for coding diseases, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or diseases.
    -   *AIDE-extension Role:* Extracting diagnostic codes or mapping clinical findings to ICD codes.
-   **RxNorm:**
    -   *Description:* A normalized naming system for generic and branded drugs.
    -   *AIDE-extension Role:* Identifying and normalizing medication names extracted from clinical text or literature to RxNorm concepts.

## Supported Healthcare Workflows

AIDE-extension aims to enhance various healthcare workflows by providing advanced data extraction and analysis capabilities:

-   **Clinical Decision Support (CDS):**
    -   *How AIDE helps:* By extracting evidence from medical literature, clinical guidelines, and patient records to provide clinicians with relevant information at the point of care.
    -   *Example:* Identifying relevant research papers or treatment protocols based on a patient's current conditions extracted from their notes.
-   **Research Data Pipelines & Cohort Building:**
    -   *How AIDE helps:* Automating the extraction of specific data points from large volumes of patient records or literature to identify patient cohorts for clinical trials or epidemiological studies.
    -   *Example:* Finding all patients with a specific diagnosis, treatment history, and lab value range from unstructured clinical notes.
-   **Pharmacovigilance & Adverse Event Reporting:**
    -   *How AIDE helps:* Identifying potential adverse drug events or side effects mentioned in clinical notes or medical literature.
-   **Regulatory Documentation & Systematic Reviews:**
    -   *How AIDE helps:* Streamlining the process of systematic literature reviews by automating the screening of papers and extraction of data for regulatory submissions or evidence synthesis.
-   **Quality Measurement & Reporting:**
    -   *How AIDE helps:* Extracting data relevant to quality metrics from patient records to support healthcare quality improvement initiatives.
-   **Public Health Surveillance:**
    -   *How AIDE helps:* Analyzing trends in clinical data or literature to detect emerging public health threats or disease outbreaks.
