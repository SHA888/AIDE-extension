# Welcome to the AIDE-extension Documentation

This site provides comprehensive documentation for the AIDE-extension project, a polyglot enhancement for the core AI-assisted Data Extraction (AIDE) R package. The extension integrates Python and Rust components to create a more powerful and versatile document processing and data extraction system, with a special focus on scientific literature and healthcare data.

## Overview

The AIDE-extension aims to:

-   Leverage **Python's AI/ML ecosystem** for sophisticated document understanding.
-   Utilize **Rust's performance** for demanding computational tasks.
-   Complement **R's statistical and data visualization** capabilities.

This approach enables AIDE to handle a wider variety of document formats, extract complex data structures, and process large datasets efficiently.
