# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Structure and Environment Configuration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Establish the foundational project structure with appropriate organization for R, Python, and Rust components, including environment configuration and dependency management.
# Details:
Create a repository with the following structure:
- `/R`: R package components and wrappers
- `/python`: Python modules for document processing and AI/ML
- `/rust`: Rust components for performance-critical operations
- `/tests`: Cross-language testing framework
- `/docs`: Documentation for all components

Implement environment detection and configuration:
- Create environment variable handling for `RETICULATE_PYTHON`, `AIDE_EXTENSION_HOME`, etc.
- Setup configuration files for R, Python, and Rust dependencies
- Implement version compatibility checking
- Create Docker configuration for development environment

Dependency files to create:
- R: DESCRIPTION file with reticulate and core AIDE dependencies
- Python: requirements.txt with pymupdf, pytesseract, spaCy, transformers, fhir.resources
- Rust: Cargo.toml with PyO3/Maturin and healthcare libraries

# Test Strategy:
Verify project structure with automated checks. Test environment detection across different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux). Validate dependency resolution with clean environment installation tests. Create CI pipeline to verify cross-language build process.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Repository Structure Creation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational directory structure for the multi-language project with R, Python, and Rust components
### Details:
Deliverables:
- Create root project directory with README.md, LICENSE, and .gitignore
- Set up language-specific subdirectories (/r, /python, /rust)
- Create shared directories (/docs, /data, /tests, /config)
- Implement cross-language integration points

Acceptance Criteria:
- Directory structure follows language-specific best practices
- README includes project overview and setup instructions
- .gitignore properly configured for all three languages
- Integration points between language components are clearly defined

## 2. Environment Configuration Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Implement environment detection and configuration handling for development, testing, and production environments
### Details:
Deliverables:
- Create environment configuration files for each context
- Implement environment detection mechanism
- Set up configuration loading for each language
- Document environment variables and configuration options

Acceptance Criteria:
- Configuration system works across all three languages
- Environment detection correctly identifies dev/test/prod
- Sensitive information is properly secured
- Configuration documentation is comprehensive and clear

## 3. Dependency Management Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Configure dependency management for R, Python, and Rust components with version pinning and reproducible builds
### Details:
Deliverables:
- Set up R package management (renv or packrat)
- Configure Python dependency management (poetry or pip with requirements.txt)
- Implement Rust dependency management (Cargo.toml)
- Create scripts for dependency installation and validation

Acceptance Criteria:
- All dependencies are explicitly defined with version constraints
- Build process is reproducible across environments
- Dependency conflicts are resolved
- Installation process is documented and automated

## 4. Docker Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Create Docker configuration for containerized development and deployment of the multi-language project
### Details:
Deliverables:
- Create Dockerfile(s) for development and production
- Implement docker-compose.yml for local development
- Configure volume mounts for development workflow
- Document Docker usage for development and deployment

Acceptance Criteria:
- Docker images successfully build with all dependencies
- Development environment matches production configuration
- Docker containers can communicate as needed
- Build and deployment process is optimized and documented
