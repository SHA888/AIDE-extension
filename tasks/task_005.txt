# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Document Structure Analysis
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create document segmentation and structure analysis to understand document organization, sections, and hierarchical relationships.
# Details:
Implement document structure analysis in Python:
```python
# aide_extension/document_processing/structure.py
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List, Dict, Optional

@dataclass
class Section:
    title: str
    level: int
    content: str
    start_page: int
    end_page: int
    subsections: List['Section']

@dataclass
class DocumentStructure:
    sections: List[Section]
    tables: List[Dict]
    figures: List[Dict]
    references: List[Dict]
    metadata: Dict

class StructureAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, config=None):
        self.config = config or {}
    
    def analyze(self, document):
        """Analyze document structure"""
        # Extract sections based on font size, formatting, etc.
        sections = self._extract_sections(document)
        
        # Build section hierarchy
        hierarchical_sections = self._build_hierarchy(sections)
        
        # Identify tables and figures
        tables = self._extract_tables(document)
        figures = self._extract_figures(document)
        
        # Extract references
        references = self._extract_references(document)
        
        return DocumentStructure(
            sections=hierarchical_sections,
            tables=tables,
            figures=figures,
            references=references,
            metadata=document.metadata
        )
```

Create R representation of document structure:
```r
# R/document_structure.R
analyze_document_structure <- function(document, options = list()) {
  # Get Python bridge
  py_bridge <- get_python_bridge()
  
  # Call Python analysis function
  py_structure <- py_bridge$analyze_structure(document)
  
  # Convert to R structure
  r_structure <- convert_from_python(py_structure)
  
  # Add R-specific methods for working with structure
  class(r_structure) <- c("aide_document_structure", class(r_structure))
  
  return(r_structure)
}

# Method for printing document structure
print.aide_document_structure <- function(x, ...) {
  cat("Document Structure:\n")
  cat("  Sections:", length(x$sections), "\n")
  cat("  Tables:", length(x$tables), "\n")
  cat("  Figures:", length(x$figures), "\n")
  cat("  References:", length(x$references), "\n")
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Test with various document types (research papers, clinical notes, etc.). Verify section hierarchy detection accuracy. Test table and figure identification. Validate reference extraction. Create visualization tests to ensure structure is properly represented.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Section Extraction and Identification [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop algorithms to identify and extract document sections based on formatting, headers, and content patterns.
### Details:
Implement regex-based and machine learning approaches for section detection. Use font size, formatting, and positional cues to identify section headers. Apply NLP techniques to classify section types (e.g., introduction, methods, results). Evaluate using precision/recall metrics against manually labeled documents. Create a section object model with attributes for title, content, level, and position.

## 2. Hierarchical Section Relationship Building [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create algorithms to establish parent-child relationships between document sections and build a complete document tree.
### Details:
Implement tree-based data structures to represent section hierarchies. Develop algorithms to determine section nesting based on header formatting and numbering schemes. Use indentation and font size as hierarchy indicators. Create visualization tools for document structure trees. Evaluate accuracy using tree edit distance metrics against gold standard document hierarchies.

## 3. Table and Figure Identification [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop methods to detect and extract tables, figures, and their captions within the document.
### Details:
Implement computer vision and pattern recognition algorithms for table detection. Use OCR and layout analysis to identify table structures. Develop caption-matching algorithms to link figures/tables with their descriptions. Create structured representations of tables with row/column relationships preserved. Evaluate using IoU (Intersection over Union) metrics for spatial detection accuracy.

## 4. Reference Extraction [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create algorithms to identify and extract citations and references, linking them to their in-text mentions.
### Details:
Implement citation pattern recognition using regex and NLP techniques. Develop algorithms to parse different citation styles (APA, MLA, etc.). Create a citation graph connecting in-text references to bibliography entries. Extract metadata from references (authors, year, title, etc.). Evaluate using F1 scores for reference detection and linking accuracy.

## 5. R Representation and Methods Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Develop R data structures and functions to represent and manipulate the extracted document structure.
### Details:
Create S3/S4 classes in R to represent document structure elements. Implement methods for traversing, searching, and manipulating document trees. Develop visualization functions using ggplot2 for document structure. Create R interfaces to Python extraction algorithms using reticulate. Package the implementation with comprehensive documentation and unit tests. Benchmark performance on large document collections.
