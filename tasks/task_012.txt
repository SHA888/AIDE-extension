# Task ID: 12
# Title: Create Comprehensive Documentation and Examples
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop thorough documentation for all components, including user guides, API references, and examples for common use cases.
# Details:
Create documentation structure:

1. User Documentation:
   - Installation guide for all components (R, Python, Rust)
   - Configuration options and environment setup
   - Basic usage examples for common tasks
   - Advanced usage patterns and customization
   - Troubleshooting guide

2. API Reference:
   - R function documentation using roxygen2
   - Python module documentation using Sphinx
   - Rust API documentation using rustdoc
   - Cross-language function mapping reference

3. Developer Documentation:
   - Architecture overview
   - Component interaction diagrams
   - Data flow documentation
   - Extension development guide
   - Testing framework documentation

4. Example Notebooks and Scripts:
   - Scientific literature extraction examples
   - Clinical document processing examples
   - Custom extraction pipeline examples
   - Performance optimization examples
   - FHIR integration examples

Implement documentation generation:
```r
# Generate R package documentation
devtools::document()

# Build package website with pkgdown
pkgdown::build_site()
```

Create example R scripts:
```r
# examples/scientific_literature.R
library(aide.extension)

# Initialize extension
initialize_python_env()

# Process scientific paper
paper_path <- system.file("examples", "sample_paper.pdf", package = "aide.extension")
result <- extract_pdf_text(paper_path)

# Analyze document structure
structure <- analyze_document_structure(result)
print(structure)

# Extract scientific entities
entities <- extract_healthcare_entities(result$text, model_type = "scientific")
print(entities)

# Visualize results
if (interactive()) {
  entity_highlighter(result$text, entities)
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Verify documentation completeness with checklist. Test examples on clean environment to ensure they work as documented. Review documentation for clarity and accuracy. Test cross-references and links. Validate API reference against actual implementation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create User Documentation and Installation Guides [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop comprehensive user documentation and installation guides for all supported platforms and environments.
### Details:
Include step-by-step installation instructions for Windows, macOS, and Linux; troubleshooting guides; system requirements; configuration options; getting started tutorials. Documentation should follow the Google Developer Documentation Style Guide. Completeness criteria: All installation paths tested and verified, screenshots included where appropriate, and feedback incorporated from at least 3 test users with different technical backgrounds.

## 2. Develop API Reference Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Create detailed API reference documentation for all supported programming languages and interfaces.
### Details:
Document all classes, methods, parameters, return values, and exceptions for Python, JavaScript, Java, and REST API interfaces. Include code examples for each method. Follow language-specific documentation standards (PEP 257 for Python, JSDoc for JavaScript, Javadoc for Java). Completeness criteria: 100% API coverage, all parameters documented, all return types specified, and examples for common use cases provided for each method.

## 3. Create Developer Documentation and Architecture Overview [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2
### Description: Develop internal developer documentation including architecture diagrams, component interactions, and contribution guidelines.
### Details:
Create system architecture diagrams (C4 model); document component interactions; data flow diagrams; sequence diagrams for key processes; deployment models; performance considerations; security guidelines; and contribution workflow. Follow the Arc42 documentation template. Completeness criteria: All major components and interactions documented, architecture decisions recorded with rationales, and documentation reviewed by the technical lead.

## 4. Develop Example Notebooks and Scripts [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2, 12.3
### Description: Create comprehensive example notebooks and scripts demonstrating common use cases and best practices.
### Details:
Develop Jupyter notebooks and executable scripts covering: data import/export, model training, inference, performance optimization, and integration with other tools. Include comments explaining each step and expected outputs. Follow PEP 8 for Python code style and include markdown explanations in notebooks. Completeness criteria: At least 10 distinct use cases covered, all examples tested in clean environments, and execution time/resource requirements documented for each example.
