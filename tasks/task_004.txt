# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Enhanced PDF Processing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop improved PDF text extraction using Python libraries like pymupdf, providing immediate value over core AIDE capabilities.
# Details:
Create Python module for enhanced PDF processing:
```python
# aide_extension/document_processing/pdf.py
import fitz  # PyMuPDF
import numpy as np

class PDFProcessor:
    def __init__(self, config=None):
        self.config = config or {}
    
    def extract_text(self, pdf_path, options=None):
        """Extract text with layout preservation"""
        doc = fitz.open(pdf_path)
        result = []
        
        for page_num in range(len(doc)):
            page = doc[page_num]
            # Extract text blocks with position information
            blocks = page.get_text("blocks")
            # Process and structure text blocks
            processed_blocks = self._process_blocks(blocks)
            result.append({
                "page": page_num + 1,
                "blocks": processed_blocks
            })
            
        return result
    
    def extract_tables(self, pdf_path, options=None):
        """Extract tables from PDF"""
        # Implement table detection and extraction
        pass
        
    def _process_blocks(self, blocks):
        """Process text blocks to preserve structure"""
        # Implement block processing logic
        pass
```

Create R wrapper for PDF processing:
```r
# R/pdf_processing.R
extract_pdf_text <- function(pdf_path, options = list()) {
  # Get Python bridge
  py_bridge <- get_python_bridge()
  
  # Convert options to Python
  py_options <- convert_to_python(options)
  
  # Call Python function
  py_result <- py_bridge$process_document(pdf_path, py_options)
  
  # Convert result back to R
  r_result <- convert_from_python(py_result)
  
  return(r_result)
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Compare extraction quality with core AIDE using benchmark PDFs. Test with complex layouts, multi-column documents, and tables. Verify text order and structure preservation. Test with documents containing images and figures. Measure performance improvements over native R methods.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Text extraction with layout preservation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement text extraction functionality that preserves the original document layout and structure
### Details:
Use PyMuPDF (fitz) and pdfplumber libraries to extract text while maintaining spatial relationships. Implement paragraph detection based on spacing patterns. Preserve hierarchical structure (headings, sections, lists). Track text coordinates to maintain reading order. Evaluate using: 1) Character accuracy rate compared to original, 2) Layout similarity metric measuring spatial arrangement preservation, 3) Processing time for documents of varying complexity.

## 2. Table detection and extraction [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop algorithms to identify and extract tabular data from PDFs with proper structure
### Details:
Implement table detection using a combination of rule-based approaches (looking for grid lines, whitespace patterns) and ML-based detection (using pre-trained models like Tabula or Camelot). Convert extracted tables to pandas DataFrames with proper column/row structure. Handle merged cells and complex layouts. Evaluate using: 1) Table detection F1-score, 2) Cell extraction accuracy, 3) Structure preservation accuracy for complex tables.

## 3. Figure and image extraction [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Extract figures, charts, and images from PDFs while preserving quality and metadata
### Details:
Use PyMuPDF to identify and extract embedded images at original resolution. Implement vector graphics conversion for charts and diagrams. Extract image captions and references by analyzing nearby text. Associate extracted images with their document context. Evaluate using: 1) Image extraction completeness (% of images successfully extracted), 2) Image quality preservation metrics, 3) Caption association accuracy.

## 4. R wrapper implementation for PDF processing [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Create R package that wraps the Python PDF processing functionality
### Details:
Use reticulate package to create R bindings for the Python functions. Implement consistent R-friendly API following tidyverse design principles. Create R data structures (tibbles, lists) from Python outputs. Write comprehensive documentation and examples. Include error handling for Python dependencies. Evaluate using: 1) Function parity with Python implementation, 2) Performance overhead compared to direct Python calls, 3) R package check compliance, 4) User testing with R analysts.
